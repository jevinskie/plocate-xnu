plocate is a locate based on posting lists. Compared to mlocate,
it is much faster, and its index is much smaller. updatedb speed
is similar (or you can convert mlocate's index to plocate format
using plocate-build). It supports most mlocate options;
see --help or the man page (man -l plocate.1) for more information.

The file format may still change (if so, plocate will notify you itself
that you need to rerun plocate-build or updatedb). To build and install,
you will need a C++17 compiler and a development package for Zstd
(https://facebook.github.io/zstd/). liburing (https://github.com/axboe/liburing)
and a kernel supporting io_uring (Linux 5.1 or newer) is optional,
but strongly recommended for best performance, especially if you
do not have an SSD. Installation is run as:

  meson setup obj
  cd obj
  ninja
  sudo addgroup --system plocate
  sudo ninja install
  sudo systemctl enable plocate-updatedb.timer

To build the database for the first time after install, you can do

  sudo updatedb

The initial run of updatedb needs to scan the entire filesystem.
Subsequent runs of updatedb will be much faster, and create a slightly (~5%)
smaller database.

If you wish to run some tests of the TurboPFor implementation against
the reference implementation, you can check it out and run as follows:

  git clone https://github.com/powturbo/TurboPFor-Integer-Compression
  ( cd TurboPFor-Integer-Compression && make -j8 )
  cd obj
  ninja reconfigure
  ninja bench
